# Simplermenu+

Simplermenu+ is an emulator launcher based on Simplemenu (https://github.com/fgl82/simplemenu) that has been written from the scratch in C++/SDL.
 
The goal is to replicate all the functionality of simplemenu but add additional features found in other emulators launcher like EmulationStation while maintaining it compatible with non-GPU accelerated devices that lack GL acceleration.
